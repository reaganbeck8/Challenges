# Challenges
Today I started creating my first web page. I learned that there is an initial outset/framework that needs to be put into place so that everything can run.
1. We start off by creating the HTML document and necessary folders.
2. Give the document a heading and a title.
   <h1></h1> (every tag has an opening and an ending)
3. Create heading 1 through 6 so that we could see the differences between the sizes of all the headings, 1 being the largest, 6 being the smallest.
4. Commands such as: 
<strong> - makes a word bold 
<em> - makes it italics
<u> - underlines it
5. The tag " <br> "  creates breaks in your text so that paragraphs do not run over the screen and becomes boring.
6.
