Brief
It's time to put your attention to detail to good use. As developers, we try to stay up to date with the latest technologies and trends, which means we subscribe to important and current news feeds, and read as much as possible about all the changes that happen in our industry. Below is content from an article which we would like to post on our website, but we need a little help laying out the HTML structure for this one. So your job will be to convert this article, images, links, etc., to the correct HTML format. 

 

Getting Started
Open your text editor on your computer

Create a new text-file and save your file with the name article_challenge.html

Save the file

Open the saved file in Chrome to see if it's saved 

Download the file (on the right-hand side, called 'article_text') with the article contents and reconstruct the article using HTML
