            We asked hundreds of parents how they manage (and don’t manage) their kids’ screen time. The answers were<br>            candid,
            scary–and sometimes hopeful.<br>

                  “I am tethered to my smartphone for both work and entertainment, as<br> is my husband. It’s omnipresent
                  and an extension of our bodies. Not<br> wanting to be left out, my 16-month-old son takes the baby monitor,<br>                  holds
                  it in his hands, and peers at it like it is a smartphone. It is<br> the cutest/most pathetic thing.”<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  That’s the eerie image a New York mom of two paints of her<br> small child’s burgeoning tech addiction.
                  Like most parents, that<br> mom lives a waking life seeped in almost non-stop screen time<br> (an average
                  American adult spends about 11 hours a day<br> looking at a screen). She, like many modern parents, sees
                  her<br> own tech dependency reflected in her children’s habits. She<br> doesn’t always like what she sees.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Even as we learn about the potential pitfalls of our increasingly<br> technology-addled lifestyles, our
                  dependence on tech shows<br> little sign of waning. Still, the anti-screen time drumbeat is<br> getting
                  louder, especially when it comes to kids.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  In November, Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who<br> was an early employee at Facebook, said
                  that the social<br> network was “ripping apart the social fabric of how society<br> works.” Tristan Harris,
                  a former product manager at Google,<br> told Wired that Apple, Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter,<br>                  and
                  Instagram design products to “hijack” our time and<br> attention. In January, two Apple investors asked
                  the company<br> to study the health effects of its products on children.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Then, last month, an unprecedented alliance of former<br> employees from some the most powerful tech companies–<br>                  including
                  Apple, Google, and Facebook–formed the Center for<br> Humane Technology. In partnership with the nonprofit
                  media<br> watchdog group Common Sense Media, the group plans to<br> lobby against addictive tech, and is
                  kicking off with a $7 million<br> “Truth about Tech” ad campaign that they plan to deliver to<br> 55,000
                  public schools.<br>

                  That the very people who championed the technology to which<br> we are addicted are now banding together
                  to warn parents<br> about the monster they’ve created is perhaps a sign that more<br> people are starting
                  to question tech’s outsized role in our lives.<br> But it feels a bit farfetched that an ad campaign, no
                  matter how<br> well-intentioned, can really help curtail our society’s addiction–<br> especially when kids
                  these days are being introduced to<br> screens at such a young age. In her book, The Art of Screen<br>                  Time
                  Anya Kamenetz cited a 2011 survey of 9,000<br> preschoolers (3- to 5-year-olds) that found that young kids<br>                  spend
                  about four hours a day in the company of (all types of)<br> screens.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  The parents who answered our survey hail from all over the<br> U.S. (and a few other countries). Their
                  professions span many<br> industries, including marketing, public relations, education,<br> finance, therapy,
                  video production, law, medicine, and<br> business. Most participants have one or two children, ranging<br>                  from
                  7 months to 18 years old. The majority of participants’<br> kids are between 3 and 11 years old; in other
                  words, these<br> parents are in the thick of parenting.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Obviously, this self-selected group of Fast Company readers<br> isn’t a conclusive sample–but, along with
                  expert research,<br> these parents’ insights help provide a snapshot of the worries<br> that burden parents
                  in our tech-dependent era.<br>
