    <u><h1>Today's Journey</h1></u>
  </strong>
  <p>Today started off with me waking up at <em>6am</em>.<br>I took a shower, got dressed and had a cup of coffee. <br>Before I knew it, it was time to actually take the 10 minute walk to the bus stop. <br>I then waited approximately 15 minutes for the bus whilst the rain was pouring. <br>The bus then journeyed through the dangerous streets of Manenberg and Hanover Park. <br>I eventually ended my bus journey at <strong>314 Imam Haron Road, Salesian Life Choices to start my day.</strong>
    <em>I learnt how to code this web page</em>
